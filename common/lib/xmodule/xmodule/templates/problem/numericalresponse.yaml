       A numerical input problem accepts a line of text input from the
       student, and evaluates the input for correctness based on its
       numerical value.

       The answer is correct if it is within a specified numerical tolerance
       of the expected answer.

       >>Enter the numerical value of Pi:<<
       = 3.14159 +- .02
       
       >>Enter the approximate value of 502*9:<<
       = 4518 +- 15%

       >>Enter the number of fingers on a human hand<<
       = 5

       [explanation]
       Pi, or the the ratio between a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an irrational number 
       known to extreme precision. It is value is approximately equal to 3.14.

       Although you can get an exact value by typing 502*9 into a calculator, the result will be close to 
       500*10, or 5,000. The grader accepts any response within 15% of the true value, 4518, so that you 
       can use any estimation technique that you like.

       If you look at your hand, you can count that you have five fingers.

   <p>
   一个数字输入问题接受学生的文字输入，并根据其数值评估输入的正确性。
   </p>

   <p>
   如果答案是在预期的答案的指定数值的公差范围内，那么就是对的
   </p>
   <script type="loncapa/python">
   computed_response = 502*9
   </script>

   <p>输入数字PI：
       <numericalresponse answer="3.14159">
           <responseparam type="tolerance" default=".02" />
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the numerical value of Pi" />
       </numericalresponse>
   </p>
   <p>输入502*9的近似值
       <numericalresponse answer="$computed_response">
           <responseparam type="tolerance" default="15%"/>
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the approximate value of 502 times 9"/>
       </numericalresponse>
   </p>

   <p>输入一个人有几根手指。
       <numericalresponse answer="5">
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the number of fingers on a human hand"/>
       </numericalresponse>
