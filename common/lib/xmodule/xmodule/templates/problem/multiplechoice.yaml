       A multiple choice problem presents radio buttons for student input. Students can only select a single 
       option presented. Multiple Choice questions have been the subject of many areas of research due to the early 
       invention and adoption of bubble sheets.
       
       One of the main elements that goes into a good multiple choice question is the existence of good distractors. 
       That is, each of the alternate responses presented to the student should be the result of a plausible mistake 
       that a student might make.

       format that did not rely on fragile and energy-intensive spinning disks.
